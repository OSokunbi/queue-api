### in-memory queue that lets you enqueue/dequeue items in constant time using an api endpoint

this is a simple in memory queue that lets you enqueue/dequeue items in constant time using an api endpoint. the queue is implemented using a doubly linked list. the queue is thread safe and can be used by multiple threads concurrently.

this is really just something i did out of boredom, though it could be useful in some cases. i'll probably use it in the future for something i guess.

## peace :P
